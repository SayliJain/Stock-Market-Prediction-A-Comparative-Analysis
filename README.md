# Stock Market Prediction: A Comparative Analysis

## Abstract
Predicting stock market directions is a complex task due to various factors, including psychological, illogical, and physical behaviors. Machine learning algorithms, employing LSTM, KNN, and linear regression, offer a promising approach to forecasting future stock prices by uncovering patterns from diverse features. Ethical considerations, such as transparency and privacy, are vital to maintaining fairness and integrity in stock market prediction.

## Problem Statement
This chapter addresses the challenges of predicting stock prices, focusing on TATAGLOBAL. Key issues include feature extraction, temporal information exploration, and model selection (Linear Regression, KNN, LSTM). The project aims to provide insights into the effectiveness of these models for stock market prediction.

## Project Description
This comprehensive project explores stock price prediction using a robust methodology and advanced machine learning models. It emphasizes meticulous data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model selection. Linear Regression, KNN, and LSTM are evaluated, with a focus on capturing temporal dependencies. The comparative analysis utilizes Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) as a metric, revealing model strengths and weaknesses.

## Analysis and Inferences:

RMSE (123.88) indicates the average deviation between actual and predicted closing prices.

Prediction visualization highlights the limitations of linear regression in capturing trends.

Model suitability is discussed, emphasizing the need for sophisticated models like LSTM and KNN.

Feature engineering, including day of the week, requires further evaluation of its impact.

## Comparison of Models:
RMSE Values:

Linear Regression: 123.88

KNN: 106.65

LSTM: 11.46

## Comparison and Contrast:

Linear Regression: Highest RMSE, less accurate predictions.

KNN: Intermediate RMSE, better than linear regression.

LSTM: Lowest RMSE, indicating superior performance.

## Actual vs. Predicted Values:

Linear Regression and KNN: Deviations observed in predicting trends.

LSTM: Predictions closely match actual values, attributed to its ability to capture temporal patterns, memory cells, non-linearity, and automatic feature learning in financial time series.

## Conclusion:

This project serves as a practical application of machine learning in finance, providing valuable insights into model selection, preprocessing, and evaluation for stock market prediction. 

The comparative analysis highlights LSTM's superior performance, emphasizing its suitability for capturing intricate patterns in financial time series data. Ethical considerations remain crucial for maintaining fairness, transparency, and privacy in stock market prediction.
